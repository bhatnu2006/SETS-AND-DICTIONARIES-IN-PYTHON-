## ✨ Sets and dictionaries in python ✨

### Aim 🎯
To study and implement Sets in Python , operations like Union, Intersection, and Difference and Frozen set .
---

### Tools Used 🧰
- Python Interpreter to run programs  
- IDLE / VS Code to write code  
- A computer with any operating system  
- add(), remove(), discard(), frozenset(), and Set Operators (|, &, -, ^).

📚 Theory

### Theory 📘
A Set is an unordered collection of items where every element is unique and must be immutable.
Unordered: Items do not have a defined order; they can appear in a different order every time you use them.Sets automatically filter out duplicate values.
Sets can contain strings, integers, and boolean values.
Boolean :In Python sets, True and 1 (as well as False and 0) are treated as the same value.
Frozen Sets
A Frozen Set is a version of a set that is immutable.
Once created, elements cannot be added or removed when we use .remove().

---

### Advantages ✅
- Ideal for tasks where only unique items are required.
- Checking if an item exists in a set (in operator) is significantly faster than in a list.
- Easily performs complex comparisons like unions and intersections in a single line of code

---

### Disadvantages ❌
- You cannot access items by index or slice them.
- While the set itself is mutable, the elements within it must be of an immutable type (you cannot put a list inside a set).

### Conclusion 📝
 😊👍Python is a beginner-friendly language.  
   sets and frozen sets shows us that how to handle data 
   We have identified overlapping data with intersections, combining datasets with unions, and isolating discrepancies through differences😊👍
